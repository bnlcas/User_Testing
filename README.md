### About ###

This repo contains unity assets (scipts, scenes and materials) to run user testing for HCI research on 3D interactions with the Meta2 Headset. In the assets folder you can find materials for 3 experiments:

* The Librarian Simulation - A gamified test requiring the user to grab target books off a shelf

* Rotation Experiment - a task where the user is supposed to rotate an object into a target orientation

* DepthInteractionTest - a task requiring to the user to grab objects at multiple depths to probe the relationship between depth perception and interaction in AR.

### Setup ###

The tests require the 2.7 Release of the Meta SDK to be installed. The Unity SDK must be installed or linked to in the Assets folder.
